# Dotfiles

These are the config files and dotfiles I use to manage my terminal environment.

I use neovim, zsh, and tmux primarily, and i install some plugins and themes etc to make it nice to use.

Details to setup things are in `setup_ubuntu.sh` which should be fine for most debian based distros.
Note that that script is not intended to be run as a single command, open it up and run it line by line.
I don't do this regularly enough to invest time in writing prompt captures and error checking etc.
